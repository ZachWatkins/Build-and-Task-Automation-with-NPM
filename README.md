This is an example package.json file that will allow you to run build and task automation from the command prompt without relying on Grunt or Gulp.

It creates a new Compass project with Zurb Foundation 5, compiles .coffee and .scss files, and watches their directories so your source files will be recompiled when you save them.

Dev Dependencies: coffee-script, compass, parallelshell, and nodemon.

To get started:

1. clone this repo to your desktop.
2. Open your command prompt and navigate to the repo.
3. Type "npm run once" and press enter.
